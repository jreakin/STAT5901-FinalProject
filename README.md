# Running files

Before starting, you must download

- The dataset from here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XJN5L5
- The dependencies and outputs from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L1NvcaC7N-tuDBnM6si4OwvaGhd0HKsZ?usp=sharing

These files are too large to upload to GitHub.

Run the files in the following order, ensuring the working directory has been set appropriately: 

- clean_data.R
- create_lexicon.R
- prepare_SLDA.R
- compare_NRC.R
- compare_AFINN.R
