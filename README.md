# STAT 5901 Final Project

In this project, a sentiment lexicon is created using Facebook reactions data. 

# Running files

Before starting, you must download the dataset from here: 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XJN5L5
This file is too large to upload to GitHub.

Run the files in the following order, ensuring the working directory has been set appropriately (the files in the "dependencies" folder should be in the working directory): 

- clean_data.R
- create_lexicon.R
- prepare_SLDA.R
- compare_NRC.R
- compare_AFINN.R
